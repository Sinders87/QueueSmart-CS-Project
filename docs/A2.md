Design and Development Methodology
Our methodology stayed iterative from Assignment 1. We implemented one screen at a time, tested it locally, then integrated it into navigation. This approach worked well because the project is UI focused and immediate visual feedback helped us catch layout issues, broken links, and data loading problems early. We also implemented a logout button.
Work was divided by feature areas. Some members focused on UI layout and styling while others implemented JavaScript behavior such as validation, navigation flow, and dynamic page updates.
