Design and Development Methodology
Our methodology did not significantly change from Assignment 1. We still used a simple iterative approach where we built small parts, tested them locally, and then integrated them. 
We kept it because the project is front end heavy and quick feedback helped us catch UI and data issues early.

Front End Technologies and Responsibilities
Technologies used
HTML for page structure
CSS for layout and styling
JavaScript for validation, session handling, and dynamic data loading
LocalStorage to simulate session state
JSON mock data to simulate backend responses
