For Assignment 2, our methodology remained the same as Assignment 1. We continued using an Agile, step-by-step approach where we built each screen, tested it locally, and then connected it to mock data. This worked well because the project focused on front-end development and allowed us to quickly fix layout, validation, and data issues. We divided the work among the four team members: one worked on authentication screens (login and registration), one developed the user screens (dashboard, join queue, queue status, and history), one built the administrator screens, and one focused on notifications. For the front end, we used HTML for structure, CSS for layout and design, JavaScript for validation and dynamic functionality, LocalStorage to simulate session handling, and JSON files to simulate backend data.
