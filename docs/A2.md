For Assignment 2, our development methodology did not change from Assignment 1. We continued using an Agile-style iterative approach, where we built each screen step by step, tested it locally, and then integrated it with mock data. This worked well because the assignment focused on front-end development, allowing us to quickly identify layout, validation, and data-loading issues. We divided the work evenly among the four team members: one worked on authentication screens (login and registration), one developed the user screens (dashboard, join queue, queue status, and history), one built the administrator screens, and one focused on styling, validations, and shared data integration.

For the front-end implementation, we used HTML to structure the pages, CSS to create a clean and consistent layout, and JavaScript to handle validations, dynamic content loading, and user interactions. We also used LocalStorage to simulate session handling and JSON files to simulate backend data such as services, queues, notifications, and history. These technologies were chosen because they are lightweight, easy to test locally, and appropriate for a front-end-only implementation while still demonstrating realistic application behavior.
